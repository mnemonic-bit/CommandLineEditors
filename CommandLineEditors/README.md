# CommandLineEditors Library

This library provides editors for the command line that can be used as a replacement
for the standard System.Console.ReadLine() method call.

The main purpose of this library is to provide command line editors which enable
command line applications to be more usable for the end-user. This includes
providing a history of entries to the user, accessible via the up- and down-keys.

Currently there is only one line-editor fully implemented, which emulates the 
ReadLine library, similar to a Emacs key-binding.
