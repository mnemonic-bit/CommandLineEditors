# CommandLineEditors Library

This library provides editors for the command line that can be used as a replacement
for the standard System.Console.ReadLine() method call.

Currently there is only one line-editor fully implemented, which emulates the 
ReadLine library, similar to a Emacs key-binding.

An early version of VI key-bindings is also in this library at the current state, but
we do not recommend using this.
